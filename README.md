# SuperRes-GANs

Super Resolution GANs (SRGANs) are a type of generative adversarial network (GAN) that can generate high-resolution images from low-resolution images. SRGANs use a generator network to increase the resolution of an image and a discriminator network to distinguish between the generated image and the original. SRGANs are typically used for image super-resolution, which is the process of increasing the resolution of an image. SRGANs can also be used for style transfer and image-to-image translation. The advantages of using SRGANs are that they are able to produce high-quality images with fewer parameters than other deep learning models, and that they can be trained on large datasets. SRGANs have been applied to a number of tasks, including image-to-image translation, image super-resolution, and style transfer.
